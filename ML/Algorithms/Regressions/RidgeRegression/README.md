# Ridge Regression

This module contains an implementation of Ridge Regression, a linear regression variant that includes regularization to prevent overfitting.

## Overview

Ridge Regression is a linear regression technique with an added regularization term to handle multicollinearity and prevent the model from becoming too complex.

## Usage

To use Ridge Regression, follow these steps:

1. Import the `RidgeRegression` class.
2. Create an instance of the class, specifying the regularization parameter (`alpha`).
3. Fit the model to your training data using the `fit` method.
4. Make predictions using the `predict` method.

Example:

```python
from RidgeRegression import RidgeRegression

ridge_model = RidgeRegression(alpha=0.1)
ridge_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = ridge_model.predict(X_test)
```

## Parameters

- `alpha`: Regularization strength. A higher alpha increases the penalty for large coefficients.

## Installation

To use this module, make sure you have the required dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy
```
