## :zap: Vision and Mission 🎯

Our vision is to create a comprehensive resource hub for learning AI algorithms and project approaches, enabling learners to quickly grasp and apply AI concepts. Our mission is to simplify AI learning, promote open-source collaboration, and foster a community of AI enthusiasts and professionals.

## :zap: Description and Purpose 📘

**AI-Code** is an open-source project aimed at providing comprehensive scratch code implementations of various algorithms in Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and other AI technologies. The project includes detailed guides, structured paths, and resources to approach real-world projects, making it easier for learners and contributors to understand and apply AI concepts effectively.

## :zap: Features 🌟

- **Algorithm Implementations**: Access and learn from scratch code implementations of various algorithms across ML, DL, NLP, GAN, and other AI domains.
- **Project Resources**: Detailed guides for real-world projects including code, datasets, research papers, videos, and more, organized for ease of learning.
- **Structured Learning**: Organized directories with README files in each category to help you navigate and understand the content quickly.
- **Hands-On Learning**: Designed for quick, hands-on learning without overwhelming users with extensive texts or overly complex projects.

## :zap: Future Scope 🔮

The AI-Code project aims to expand in the following areas:

- Adding more algorithm implementations across different AI domains.
- Developing detailed guides for new real-world projects with comprehensive resources.
- Enhancing documentation and tutorials for better understanding and accessibility.
- Including code for loss functions, optimization techniques, and other critical AI components such as activation functions, data preprocessing methods, and model evaluation metrics.
- Encouraging contributions of research papers, new AI technologies, and innovative project ideas.

## :zap: How to Approach the Project 🌐

### Beginner Level 🌱

1. **Explore the Repositories**: Start by navigating through the directories to familiarize yourself with the structure.
2. **Read Documentation**: Go through the README files in each directory to understand the purpose and implementation of different algorithms.
3. **Run Simple Algorithms**: Execute basic algorithms in the `ML` and `Python-Scripts` directories to get hands-on experience.

### Intermediate Level 🌿

1. **Write Test Cases**: For the algorithms you understand, write test cases to validate their functionality.
2. **Implement Your Own Algorithms**: Try coding algorithms from scratch and compare with existing implementations.
3. **Contribute to Documentation**: Improve and clarify existing documentation to help other learners understand the scratch code better.

### Advanced Level 🌳

1. **Research and Development**: Go through research papers and published works to understand new algorithms, projects, and AI technologies.
2. **Real-World Projects**: Start working on the detailed project guides available in the respective directories.
3. **Create New Projects**: Develop and document new projects, including all necessary resources like code, datasets, and research papers.
4. **Code Enhancements**: Contribute code for loss functions, optimization techniques, activation functions, data preprocessing methods, and model evaluation metrics.
5. **Mentor Others**: Engage with the community by helping others, reviewing pull requests, and contributing to discussions.
